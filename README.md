# Map generation using the Wave-function Collapse algorithm

An implementation of the wave-function collapse algorithm, generating a tile-based map of an island.

The main file is beadando-wfc.ipynb which handles the generation and display of the map.
Additional file tiledict.py contains the data for the map elements used by the generating algorithm; and rotation.py contains the code for assigning images to the generated data structure.
The images included are the tiles from which the map is rendered.

An example map generated by the algorithm:
